### Project Overview
This project provides a clear and transparent view of furniture sales data across the United States, highlighting performance trends, shipping behaviors, and regional differences. It aims to equip stakeholders with actionable insights to optimize sales strategies, refine shipping processes, and understand regional demand patterns. This report presents a well-curated and interactive Excel dashboard that delves deep into sales metrics, shipping performance, and regional trends.

### Data Source
The dataset was sourced from a fictional U.S. furniture retail company’s sales and shipping logs for one full year. It includes data fields like sales, profits, quantities, shipping methods, shipping durations, and state-level performance.

### Tools
- Excel: Data cleaning, transformation, and visualization (Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and Dashboard Design).
- Power Query in Excel: Data cleaning and transformation.

### Dashboard

### Processes
- Step 1: Data Cleaning and Transformation
Used Power Query to:
  - Remove missing values and duplicates.
  - Standardize data formats (e.g., dates, categories).
  - Remove irrelevant columns to focus on essential metrics.
  - Correct data types for accurate analysis.
  - Extract month columns to analyze seasonal patterns.
  - Calculate shipping duration (Order Date Ship Date) and add a suffix (e.g., “days”) for clarity.

- Step 2: Dashboard Creation and Design
   - Developed an interactive Excel dashboard using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts.
   - Implemented dynamic insights to track:
   - Top-performing product categories.
   - Shipping mode preferences.
   - Monthly sales trends.
   - Regional performance mapping.
   - Created a custom dashboard layout and design for clear storytelling.
  - Added dynamic titles and filters for region/segment-based analysis.

### Key Insights
This report dives into several critical areas to reveal the story of our sales performance:
- Sales Trends Analysis: Uncovering historical patterns in sales, order volumes, and average order value (AOV).
- Product-Level Performance: Evaluating which furniture products lead in revenue and profitability.
- Regional Impact: Mapping out our top-performing states and cities to identify growth markets.
- Shipping Patterns: Assessing delivery preferences and their effect on sales.
- Opportunities & Recommendations: Providing practical strategies to boost revenue and profitability

#### Executive Summary: Overview of Findings
Our analysis revealed a compelling yet complex narrative:
Revenue reached $742,000, a healthy 8% year-over-year increase. Total orders grew to 8,000 units, an 11% increase from the previous year.
However, profitability was squeezed—profit dropped by 57% to $18,500.
This discrepancy between top-line growth and bottom-line profitability highlights underlying operational and product-specific challenges.

#### Sales Trends
- Total revenue reached $742,000, reflecting an 8% year-over-year growth, indicating strong overall demand.
- Sales exhibit a clear seasonal trend, peaking in December at $121,800, likely driven by holiday shopping.
- Despite an 11% increase in quantity sold, profitability declined sharply by 57%, suggesting rising costs or pricing pressures that require further investigation.
- While sales volume and revenue growth highlight expanding market penetration, the compression of profit margins points to potential operational inefficiencies or increased discounting.

#### Product-Level Performance
- Chairs are the top-performing category, generating $328,400 in revenue and accounting for nearly 44% of total sales.
- Tables and Bookcases follow with revenues of $207,000 and $114,900, respectively. Together, these categories contribute over 85% of total sales, indicating a concentrated product portfolio.
- Prioritizing these key categories in marketing and inventory strategies will likely maximize return on investment.

#### Regional Impact
- California leads as the highest revenue-generating state with $156,100, followed by New York.
- Among cities, New York City is the top sales location with $75,700 in revenue, complemented by significant contributions from Los Angeles ($54,000), Seattle ($41,000), Philadelphia ($36,500), and San Francisco ($36,400).
- These regional hotspots represent key opportunities for targeted marketing initiatives and localized campaigns to drive further growth.
- Regional variations in customer preferences and economic factors may contribute to differences in sales and profitability, warranting deeper analysis.

### Recommendations
- Prioritize High-Demand Categories: Focus marketing and inventory efforts on Chairs to boost sales.
- Leverage Seasonal Trends: Introduce targeted holiday campaigns in December to capitalize on peak seasonal demand.
- Strengthen Regional Strategies: Tailor campaigns for New York and California while exploring growth in underperforming regions.
- Optimize Shipping Costs: Balance customer needs with cost-saving measures to sustain profit margins.
 - Investigate Profit Margins: Explore areas driving declining profits despite sales growth, such as shipping cost structures or vendor pricing.
