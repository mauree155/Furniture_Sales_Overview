### Project Overview
This project provides a clear and transparent view of furniture sales data across the United States, highlighting performance trends, shipping behaviors, and regional differences. It aims to equip stakeholders with actionable insights to optimize sales strategies, refine shipping processes, and understand regional demand patterns. This report presents a well-curated and interactive Excel dashboard that delves deep into sales metrics, shipping performance, and regional trends.

### Data Source
The dataset was sourced from a fictional U.S. furniture retail company’s sales and shipping logs for one full year. It includes data fields like sales, profits, quantities, shipping methods, shipping durations, and state-level performance.

### Processes
- Step 1: Data Cleaning and Transformation
Used Power Query to:
  - Remove missing values and duplicates.
  - Standardize data formats (e.g., dates, categories).
  - Remove irrelevant columns to focus on essential metrics.
  - Correct data types for accurate analysis.
  - Extract month columns to analyze seasonal patterns.
  - Calculate shipping duration (Order Date Ship Date) and add a suffix (e.g., “days”) for clarity.

- Step 2: Dashboard Creation and Design
   - Developed an interactive Excel dashboard using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts.
   - Implemented dynamic insights to track:
   - Top-performing product categories.
   - Shipping mode preferences.
   - Monthly sales trends.
   - Regional performance mapping.
   - Created a custom dashboard layout and design for clear storytelling.
  - Added dynamic titles and filters for region/segment-based analysis.

### Key Insights
This report dives into several critical areas to reveal the story of our sales performance:
- Sales Trends Analysis: Uncovering historical patterns in sales, order volumes, and average order value (AOV).
- Product-Level Performance: Evaluating which furniture products lead in revenue and profitability.
- Regional Impact: Mapping out our top-performing states and cities to identify growth markets.
- Shipping Patterns: Assessing delivery preferences and their effect on sales.
- Opportunities & Recommendations: Providing practical strategies to boost revenue and profitability

#### Executive Summary: Overview of Findings
Our analysis revealed a compelling yet complex narrative:
Revenue reached $742,000, a healthy 8% year-over-year increase. Total orders grew to 8,000 units, an 11% increase from the previous year.
However, profitability was squeezed—profit dropped by 57% to $18,500.
This discrepancy between top-line growth and bottom-line profitability highlights underlying operational and product-specific challenges.

#### Sales Trends
- Total revenue reached $742,000, reflecting an 8% year-over-year growth, indicating strong overall demand.
- Sales exhibit a clear seasonal trend, peaking in December at $121,800, likely driven by holiday shopping.
- Despite an 11% increase in quantity sold, profitability declined sharply by 57%, suggesting rising costs or pricing pressures that require further investigation.
- While sales volume and revenue growth highlight expanding market penetration, the compression of profit margins points to potential operational inefficiencies or increased discounting.

#### Shipping Patterns
The analysis of shipping modes reveals clear customer preferences and opportunities for improvement:
- Standard Class is by far the most preferred shipping option, accounting for 59% of all orders.
- Second Class follows with 19%, while First Class and Same Day account for 16% and 5%, respectively.
- The most common delivery time across all orders is four days, representing 28% of shipments.
- This pattern suggests that the majority of customers are comfortable with slightly longer delivery times if it means lower costs, emphasizing value-driven decision-making.

### Recommendations
 #### Sales Performance
- Sustain Strong Demand:
Capitalize on the observed 8% year-over-year revenue growth and the 11% increase in order volumes by refining marketing campaigns and customer engagement strategies.
Leverage the December sales peak by preparing seasonal promotions and inventory well in advance to capture holiday-driven demand.
- Address Profitability Challenges:
Investigate the 57% decline in profitability despite sales growth.
Analyze cost structures, discounting practices, and operational inefficiencies to identify and address margin pressures.
Implement targeted cost-control measures and review pricing strategies to maintain healthy profit margins.

#### Product-Level Focus
- Prioritize Best-Selling Categories:
Chairs, Tables, and Bookcases together account for over 85% of total revenue—focus marketing and inventory investments on these top-performing categories.
Develop targeted promotions to further drive sales in these key categories.
- Refine Product Strategy:
Conduct a margin analysis by product category to pinpoint underperforming segments that may be eroding profitability.
Consider phasing out or repositioning low-margin or low-demand products to sharpen the product portfolio and maximize ROI.

#### Regional Strategies
- Leverage High-Performing Regions:
Focus on California (highest revenue: $156,100) and New York (including New York City at $75,700) as key revenue drivers.
Strengthen localized marketing campaigns in top cities—Los Angeles, Seattle, Philadelphia, and San Francisco—to capitalize on their sales potential.
- Explore Regional Nuances:
Analyze regional economic conditions and customer preferences to tailor campaigns, pricing, and product offerings.
Consider expanding fulfillment centers or distribution partnerships in these urban hubs to reduce delivery times and costs, enhancing customer satisfaction.

#### Shipping & Logistics
- Optimize Standard Shipping:
Standard Class shipping accounts for 59% of orders, with most deliveries completed in four days for 28% of shipments.
Focus on improving logistics for this mode to reduce shipping costs, boost efficiency, and maintain the balance between speed and value for customers.
- Enhance Premium Shipping Options:
Although less utilized (Same Day at 5% and First Class at 16%), consider positioning premium shipping options as upsell opportunities for high-value customers during peak seasons.
